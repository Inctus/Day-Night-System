# Day-Night-System

In this repo, you can find code used in my YouTube video [here](https://youtu.be/uQp-f7Rjxf8)

The code is a dynamic day/night system that is built on top of the default ROBLOX one, to **counteract problems** such as undefined shadows and lack of light at night time. 

It gives you **much more control** over how you want your day and night to appear in a game. 

I have uploaded the source code as **Source.lua** and the assosciated effects into **DayNightFX.rbxm**.
